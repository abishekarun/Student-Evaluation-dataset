## Student Evaluation Data

In this project, we try to reproduce the results obtained by this [paper](https://github.com/abishekarun/Student-Evaluation-dataset/blob/master/LA_EdMining_SanghoSuh.pdf) on [Turkiye Student evaluation dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/turkiye+student+evaluation). This project was also used to explore different regression models in matlab.

The final matlab file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Student-Evaluation-dataset/blob/master/student_evalution.m) for this project and rendered html file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Student-Evaluation-dataset/blob/master/html/student_evaluation.html).
